# Preliminary
Since I started to remake Darklands from Microprose as a Means to learn UE4 I searched the web for references.
I found some very interesting things. 

I copied from https://wendigo.online-siesta.com/darklands/ which has an excellent start point for the formats used in the game
There is even a github https://github.com/vvendigo/Darklands

## Python
Unfortunately de coding itself is in Python. Which I admire as a programming language but know nothing. 
Guess I have to figure that one out

... well lets see what we can find out
